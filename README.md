# Basic Problem-Solving-in-Python

HELLO I'm a student at NIT Rourkela, and this is my first Repository while learning basics of PYTHON programmming.


Repository Contents:

This repository contains beginner-level Python programs to solve basic problems like:
  ~ Prime and Composite number checker
  ~ Star Pattern Printing
  ~ Loop-based logic building
  ~ Use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' statements for decision making
  ~ A simple text-based game built using basic Python concepts such as 'if-else', 'loops', and 'input()'. It's designed to help beginners understand control structures and loging building in        PYTHON.
