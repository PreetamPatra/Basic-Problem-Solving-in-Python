# Basic Problem-Solving-in-Python

Hii everyone, I'm a first-year B.Tech student at NIT Rourkela and this is my very first Repository - a beginning to programmming with PYTHON!
In this repository I present my process of developing logical thinking, practicing how to structure code and approaching simple prolems as a biginner, using basic and fundamental concept in Python.


This Repository Contains simple yet meaningful Python programs that demonstrate:

  ~ Prime and Composite number checking
  ~ Star Pattern Printing
  ~ Looping logic
  ~ Using 'if', 'elif' and 'else' statements for decision making
  ~ A simple text-based game built using basic Python concepts such as 'if-else', 'loops', and 'input()'. 


Every great journey begins with one small step, this repo is mine.
Thank you for stopping by!!
